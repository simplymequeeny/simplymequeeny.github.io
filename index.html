        <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>Animal healthcare has always played second fiddle when compared to the evolution of human
          health care. This gap in infrastructure has made access to animal health care complex and
          inefficient.</p>
        <p>We at Manakn strive to fill this gap through innovation by leveraging advancements in
          Artificial Intelligence. Our state of the art pet management and practice automation solutions
          stand testament to the capabilities of AI in animal care.</p>
